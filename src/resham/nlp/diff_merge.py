    Rules (TDD §6):
    - occasion/color_preference/size/budget_max: explicit new values overwrite.
    - style_descriptors/excluded: accumulate rather than overwrite *within
      the same topic* — a genuine topic change (occasion changes) resets
      style_descriptors along with deadline_date, since style words
      describing the old occasion ("traditional" for a wedding) don't
      carry over to a genuinely new one ("casual" for a daily-wear ask).
      Real bug this fixes: style_descriptors accumulated forever with no
      reset at all, so the displayed "Style" chip — which shows the
      *oldest* accumulated word — stayed stuck on whatever was said
      first, no matter how much the shopper's intent moved on.
    - brands is untouched here — only mutated by the fast-path "different
      brand" rule, not by LLM diffs, in this phase.
